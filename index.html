			<p>Hello!</p>
			<p>My name is Carlos Wilkes, and this website is dedicated to my projects.</p>
			<p>I'm from England, and I've been developing games, prototypes, shaders, artwork, and everything in between for over 17 years. My favourite aspect of game development is programming, and I began with the DarkBASIC programming language, later moving on to C++, and now use C#. I used to make games quite often to enter and win game development competitions, but for the past seven years I've been addicted to making Unity <a href="http://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/1513?aid=1101l4Jks">Asset Store</a> products.</p>
			<p>Most of my assets focus on solving difficult or tedious programming tasks, and packinging it in a way that makes it easy for anyone to use. For example, every time I started a project for mobile devices I would waste time writing the same input code over and over again, and so I created <a href="http://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/30111?aid=1101l4Jks">Lean Touch</a> to solve this problem once and for all.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions then please contact me at: <a href="mailto:carlos.wilkes@gmail.com">carlos.wilkes@gmail.com</a></p>

					<p><strong>Astrodude (1.0)</strong> is a game I made for the Intel AppUp store (now discontinued), and is the first game I commercially published.</p>
					<p>This contained media from the original "Astrodude 0.3" game, but it was rewritten from scratch. Some parts like the UI system even bypassed the DarkGDK library entirely, and were rendered directly using D3D9 API calls.</p>
					<p>Since it was a commercial release, I wanted to include more features than just the car racing feature from the original competition version, so I made levels where you control the astrodude himself to avoid dangers and collect eggs. The eggs are then used to unlock new levels, and I put a lot of polish into each aspect.</p>

					<p><strong>Astrodude (0.3)</strong> is a game I entered into the Intel Netbook Competition, hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_94.html">1st place</a>, also announced <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/145151/Winners_of_The_Game_Creators_and_Intel_GamesnbspforNotebooks_Competition_Announced.php">HERE</a>.</p>
					<p>The theme of the competition was to make a game suitable for the new Intel Netbook range, which were basically mini laptops. I decided to make a car physics based dodging game, where you can use the trackpad to 'swipe' the car to dodge obstacles.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming for this game using C++ with the DarkGDK graphics library, and all the artwork in Photoshop. The biggest challenge I faced when making this game was handling the deformation of the terrain. I had to develop a system to efficiently generate (and regenerate) the collision mesh at runtime based on the explosions that deformed the surface. This was quite a challenge because I wasn't aware this had been done before and the algorithm was called Marching Squares, and so I developed the algorithm on my own from scratch.</p>
					<p>The idea with this competition was that the game would later be published on Intel's "App Up" store (now discontinued). In preparing this game for publishing I discovered that due to NPOT scaling issues, my game wouldn't function correctly on some devices. Accounting for this issue was quite difficult using the DarkGDK graphics API, and I wanted to include some more features for the commercially published version, and so I decided to re-write the game from scratch and release it as version 1.0.</p>
					<p>You can download the final competition entry from <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/s/tw4hxyiscm9mgxc/Astrodude_0_3.zip?dl=1">HERE</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Judges</strong> - <em>"Have everything you understand about physics tested to the maximum in this 2D physics-based driving game. It's a tried and tested formula but with a twist. Set in an extra-terrestrial environment with just enough gravity to keep you planet-bound, the camera view is fixed to the orientation of your dune buggy. Rather than lose your vehicle and starting again when you overturn it, your whole world is turned upside down too. You'll have to wrestle with recovering your vehicle whilst baffled by working out the physical aspects in a upturned world.
					<br/>Duffy, our Intel judge, reports "Astrodude scored the highest across the board. Well done graphics, good game play for a netbook...'track pad' swipe for a boost is brilliant.""</em></p>

					<p><strong>evo.war</strong> is a game I entered into the Community Competition, hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_77.html">5th place</a>.</p>
					<p>I don't think there was any particular theme, so I just experimented with every idea that popped into my head. What I came up with was a shoot-em-up where the enemies 'evolve' based on how easily you were able to kill them. All ships including your own used the same code, except you were able to choose your upgrades, whereas the enemies were just random mutations. In the end this system didn't really make for fun gameplay or enemies that made any visual sense, so I scrapped the evolving enemy part and just hand-made them.</p>
					<p>I did all programming in this game using C++ with the DarkGDK graphics library. This library doesn't contain any of the fancy feature we now know and love, so developing this game required me to create a UI system from scratch, including a sprite font system. I also developed the ribbon trail (missile trail) system from scratch, which required a lot of mesh manipulation code. I also did some procedural texture work for the progress line, and voronoi upgrade UI picker. The levels are based on text file parsing, and there are many small things I made like a playlist system, particle system, weapon system, modular part handling system, star shadow system, and much more.</p>

					<p><strong>Judges</strong> - <em>"Evo.war is another fine entry from Darkcoder. The attention to visual detail and innovative game play sets it aside from other entries. The principle behind the game is to take a standard side scrolling shooter in the R-Type style, and collect DNA as you work through the levels. You can then "evolve" your ship using collected DNA creating different designs. Starting as a humble egg-shaped craft, progress through the levels with varying weapon configurations. The game play can be very intense at times, almost frustrating; however the ability to adapt your ship to your preferred playing style is a great advantage."</em></p>
