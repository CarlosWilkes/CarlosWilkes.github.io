					<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
				</a>
				<div class="info" style="padding-top: 0;">
					<p>My name is Carlos Wilkes, and I'm from England. This website is dedicated to my projects.</p>
					<p>I've been developing games, prototypes, shaders, artwork, and everything in between for over 17 years. My favourite aspect of game development is programming - I began with the DarkBASIC programming language, later moving on to C++, and now use C#. For the past seven years I've been addicted to making Unity <a href="Get/Assets" target="_blank">Asset Store</a> products.</p>
					<p>Most of my assets focus on solving difficult or tedious programming tasks, and packaging it in a way that makes it easy for anyone to use. For example, every time I started a project for mobile devices I would waste time writing the same input code over and over again, and so I created <a href="Get/LeanTouch" target="_blank">Lean Touch</a> to solve this problem once and for all.</p>

					<p>Make the space scene of your dreams using <strong>Space Graphics Toolkit</strong>. This huge collection of space effects can be customized and combined in any way you like, allowing you to quickly make realistic or fantasy worlds.</p>
<!-- SpaceGraphicsToolkit -->
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Atmosphere_t.jpg" alt="Volumetric Atmosphere" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Atmosphere.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Volumetric Atmosphere</h2> <p>With a few clicks you can add this highly optimized atmospheric haze around your planets. This effect is volumetric, so you can seamlessly travel from space to your planet surface. You can create any kind of atmosphere you like with this, because you have full control over the atmosphere color, sunset color, atmospheric scattering, fog, and much more.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Planet_t.jpg" alt="Detailed Planets" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Planet.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Detailed Planets</h2> <p>This package comes with a powerful planet shader, allowing you to transform your basic PBR planet textures into a breathtaking new world. The detail system ensures your planets look great, even when zoomed in. The water system adds impressive animated oceans, and you even dynamically adjust the water height.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Terrain_t.jpg" alt="Dynamic LOD" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Terrain.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Dynamic LOD</h2> <p>Making planets using normal unity meshes just doesn't work, because each triangle gets too big when you scale a planet to a realistic size. To fix this, you need to use some kind of planetary LOD system. The SGT Terrain feature does this for you, automatically increasing the planet mesh detail as you approach. This feature also comes with components to procedurally alter the height, procedurally spawn objects, and much more.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Land_t.jpg" alt="Planetary Landing" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Land.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Planetary Landing</h2> <p>With the Dynamic LOD and Volumetric Atmosphere features you can seamlessly travel from space to the surface of your planets. The planet surface automatically generates colliders, so you can even land on the surface, spawn normal physics objects, and much more!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Shadow_t.jpg" alt="Accurate Dynamic Shadows" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Shadow.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Accurate Dynamic Shadows</h2> <p>Unity's built-in shadow system works great for small nearby objects, but it's useless in space. That's why SGT comes with a custom shadow system that allows you to cast incredibly high detail & high performance shadows from planets, gas giants, and rings. This system works alongside Unity's built-in shadows, so your planet surfaces will still look great.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Jovian_t.jpg" alt="Volumetric Gas Giants" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Jovian.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Volumetric Gas Giants</h2> <p>Let's not forget about gas giants! The SGT Jovian component allows you to quickly make impressive gas giants. The SGT Jovian effect is fully volumetric, so you can fly from space and through your gas giant seamlessly. You also get full control over the atmosphere density, atmospheric scattering, rim color, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Backdrop_t.jpg" alt="Procedural Starfields" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Backdrop.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Procedural Starfields</h2> <p>Did you know that skyboxes are terrible for space games? A 2048x2048 skybox can use as much as 72MB of texture memory, yet still look bad when zoomed in! Space Graphics Toolkit solves this issue using the backdrop feature, which allows you to create cloud/star/galaxy backgrounds that take up very little memory, are fully procedural, look great when zoomed in, and run on mobiles too!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Corona_t.jpg" alt="Volumetric Corona" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Corona.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Volumetric Corona</h2> <p>This feature allows you to turn boring spheres into impressively glowing balls of fire that actually look like stars. The corona is fully volumetric too, so you can seamlessly travel from space down to the surface.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Prominence_t.jpg" alt="Animated Prominence" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Prominence.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Animated Prominence</h2> <p>If the corona feature wasn't enough, then you can also layer on top some solar prominences. This effect looks great from any angle, and makes your stars look even more impressive.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Star_t.jpg" alt="Animated Stars" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Star.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Animated Stars</h2> <p>The last two features make the outside of your star look great, but what about the surface? SGT comes with a star surface shader that is fully procedural, including procedural animation, making your star look alive.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Flare_t.jpg" alt="Detailed Flares" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Flare.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Detailed Flares</h2> <p>The last three features make your star look great up close, but what about from afar? The SGT Flare feature allows you to make beautiful star flare billboards, just look at the screenshots using them! These flares are fully customizable to your taste, and have advanced features like smoothly occluding behind foreground objects, and correctly rotating to camera orientation.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Cloudsphere_t.jpg" alt="Cloudsphere" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Cloudsphere.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Cloudsphere</h2> <p>If your planet has an atmosphere, then it probably has clouds too. The SGT Cloudsphere effect allows you to add a cloud layer on top, giving you control over the colors, distance fading, and much more.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Lightning_t.jpg" alt="Animated Lightning" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Lightning.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Animated Lightning</h2> <p>If your planet has clouds, then it probably has lightning storms too. The SGT Lightning effect allows you to procedurally spawn animated lightning around your planets.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Aurora_t.jpg" alt="Animated Aurora" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Aurora.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Animated Aurora</h2> <p>To make your planets look more exotic you can add the aurora effect, which adds glowing trails over the poles. This effect is procedurally generated and animated, and also heavily optimized. If you don't like the preset colors or shape then you have full control over how they are generated.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Ring_t.jpg" alt="Detailed Rings" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Ring.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Detailed Rings</h2> <p>The SGT Ring effect allows you to quickly add a planetary ring around your planets. You can easily control the ring inner & outer radius, enable light scattering, add an animated asteroid detail map for when you get close, and it even splits the ring up into multiple segments to correctly handle depth sorting!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Singularity_t.jpg" alt="Black Holes" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Singularity.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Black Holes</h2> <p>The Singularity feature allows you to add impressive black holes to your scene in just a few clicks. This effect bends light from objects behind it, and you get full control over the radius, distortion power, and can even add an unrealistic but cool looking color tint around the edges.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Accretion_t.jpg" alt="Accretion Discs" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Accretion.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Accretion Discs</h2> <p>Allows you to create animated accretion discs, with full control over the inner & outer radius, light twist strength, animation speed, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Spacetime_t.jpg" alt="Gravitational Waves" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Spacetime.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Gravitational Waves</h2> <p>If you really want to show off what gravity looks like, then you need to use the SGT Spacetime effect. This allows you to visualize the gravitational distortion caused by planets/stars/etc, and even allows you to simulate gravitational waves.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Infinite_t.jpg" alt="Infinite Scrolling" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Infinite.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Infinite Scrolling</h2> <p>Space is big, and to simulate movement you really need to have things whizzing by the player. The SGT Starfield Infinite effect allows you to make infinitely repeating clouds/stars/dust that flies by the camera as you move.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Starfield_t.jpg" alt="Procedural Starfields" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Starfield.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Procedural Starfields</h2> <p>Space Graphics Toolkit comes with a powerful starfield generation system, which allows you to create elliptical galaxies, spiral galaxies, and much more. These starfields render with incredible performance, detail, and you have the ability to customize every aspect of their appearence.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Debris_t.jpg" alt="Procedural Asteroids" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Debris.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Procedural Asteroids</h2> <p>Space Graphics Toolkit includes a number of systems to prcoedurally spawn asteroids and other debris around the camera. These can be spawned in orbits like the asteroid belt, around the camera so players can interact with them, and much more!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Universe_t.jpg" alt="Floating Origin System" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Universe.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Floating Origin System</h2> <p>If you've ever tried making massive scenes in Unity, you know that everything starts to break very quickly. To fix this, you need to use a floating origin system to keep everything close to your camera. SGT comes with an advanced yet easy to use system that allows you to simulate a universe over 50 billion lightyears in each direction! It also comes with procedural spawning components so you can quickly fill all this space up.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Photo_t.jpg" alt="Photorealism" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/SpaceGraphicsToolkit/Photo.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Photorealism</h2> <p>You're not just limited to fantasy worlds when using Space Graphics Toolkit. With careful adjustment of the settings you can also achieve visual results that are almost indistinguishable from real life, making it perfect for space simulations.</p>

					<p><strong>Paint in 3D</strong> allows you to paint all the objects in your scene - both in game, and in editor. All features are optimized with GPU accelerated texture painting, so you can enjoy consistent performance, even if you paint your objects one million times!</p>
<!-- PaintIn3D -->
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Consistent_t.jpg" alt="Consistent Performance" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Consistent.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Consistent Performance</h2> <p>The reason why Paint in 3D runs so fast even if you paint a lot is because the paint is baked into the textures of your object. Your objects already have textures, so why not use them, right? The code also produces no garbage (0 gc alloc), so you don't have to worry about random lag spikes.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Lightning_t.jpg" alt="Lightning Fast Painting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Lightning.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Lightning Fast Painting</h2> <p>Baking paint into textures may sound slow, but the painting code is done 100% on the GPU, which actually makes it incredibly fast. The painting code has also been heavily optimized to minimize state changes by batching paint operations together.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Platforms_t.jpg" alt="Mobile & Console & VR Support" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Platforms.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Mobile & Console & VR Support</h2> <p>Painting works great on all platforms and devices that support render textures. You can easily set painting up on VR too, with controller paint brushes, spray cans, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Skinned_t.jpg" alt="Skinned Mesh Painting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Skinned.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Skinned Mesh Painting</h2> <p>Paint in 3D allows you to paint animated objects with great performance. Check out the WebGL Demo and see how great the zombie paint looks.</p>
					</div>

						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Seamless_t.jpg" alt="Seamless UV Painting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Seamless.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Seamless UV Painting</h2> <p>If you have a complex mesh it's common to get seams when painting, even when using professional painting software. Paint in 3D solves this with the 'Seam Fixer' tool that comes included. Paint in 3D also makes painting between multiple objects seamless, even if they have different scales.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Team_t.jpg" alt="Team Based Painting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Team.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Team Based Painting</h2> <p>Paint in 3D comes with an easy to use team based painting feature. Where you can assign a specific color to a specific team, and count how many pixels each team has painted in your scene!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Multi_t.jpg" alt="Multi-Texture Painting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Multi.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Multi-Texture Painting</h2> <p>If you have a complex material & shader that has multiple textures that work together, then no problem. Paint in 3D allows you to create brushes that paint multiple textures at the same time, and to give each brush unique settings.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Full_t.jpg" alt="Full Material Support" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Full.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Full Material Support</h2> <p>Paint in 3D not only supports painting all the materials & shaders that come with Unity, but all of your custom ones too! Using the intuitive inspector you can easily pick which materials and textures you want to paint.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Editor_t.jpg" alt="In Game & In Editor" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Editor.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>In Game & In Editor</h2> <p>Paint in 3D was designed from the start to support painting in game as well as in the editor. This allows you to quickly tweak your textures in the editor, and later paint them in game, using the exact same features.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Blending_t.jpg" alt="Blending Modes" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Blending.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Blending Modes</h2> <p>You're not limited to painting just normal albedo textures. Paint in 3D has a range of blending modes and settings that allow you to paint any kind of texture you like. For example, additive blending for illumination textures, RGB isolated alpha blending for cutout textures, and much more.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/PaintIn3D/Undo_t.jpg" alt="Undo & Redo" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/PaintIn3D/Undo.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Undo & Redo</h2> <p>Full undo and redo support in editor, and at runtime. If you have a complex game then you can easily control this manually with the simple C# API.</p>

						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Explosions_t.jpg" alt="Explosions" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Explosions.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Explosions</h2> <p>This feature allows you to damage your sprites from raycasts, collisions, and much more. The explosion shape can be customized using any <strong>Texture2D</strong> you like, and I've even included many explosion prefabs to get you going!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Splitting_t.jpg" alt="Splitting" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Splitting.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Splitting</h2> <p>If you stamp or slice your destructible sprite into multiple pieces, then this feature makes them automatically split into multiple parts!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Optimized_t.jpg" alt="Optimized" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Optimized.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Optimized</h2> <p>If you need your game to run on mobiles then you can click one button to reduce the amount of pixels used. The destruction pixels are stored separately from the visual pixels, so your sprites will still look crisp!

If you have large destructible objects then you need complex collider shapes, but these are slow to regenerate/update. To fix this, Destructible 2D optimizes the colliders into grid cells, so only modified colliders get updated!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Slicing_t.jpg" alt="Slicing" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Slicing.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Slicing</h2> <p>This destruction mode allows you to slice between two points on the screen, this can be done using the mouse or on mobile devices with fingers!</p>

						<h2>Fracturing</h2> <p>If you need your destructible sprite to randomly break into smaller pieces (e.g. cracking an egg), then this feature automatically works when you hit your object enough times!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Healing_t.jpg" alt="Healing" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Healing.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Healing</h2> <p>If you want to undo or repair damage done to a destructible sprite then you can heal it using stamps, slices, explosions, or have the whole sprite automatically heal itself over time!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Scorch_t.jpg" alt="Scorch Marks" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Scorch.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Scorch Marks</h2> <p>Cutting holes in sprites is nice, but to really show damage you need scorch marks around the damaged area, and this feature makes it really easy!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Counter_t.jpg" alt="Damage Counter" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Counter.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Damage Counter</h2> <p>If you need to check how much damage you've done to your destructible sprite then this feature is great. You can see how many pixels you have left, or what % of pixels remain!</p>

						<h2>Sprite Swapping</h2> <p>Cutting holes and adding scorch marks to sprites is great, but if you also want to swap the visual sprite underneath based on impact or pixel damage, then this feature allows you to easily do it!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Detachable_t.jpg" alt="Detachable" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Detachable.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>
						<h2>Detachable</h2> <p>If you have a solid object with parts you want to be able to break/cut off (e.g. a tree with branches), then this feature allows you to easily handle that!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="feature">
						<lightbox tabindex="0"><img src="Content/Destructible2D/Transparency_t.jpg" alt="Transparency" /><div tabindex="0"><span style="background-image: url('Content/Destructible2D/Transparency.jpg')" /></div></lightbox>

					<p>Since it was a commercial release, I wanted to include more features than just the car racing feature from the original competition version, so I made levels where you control the astrodude himself to avoid dangers and collect eggs. The eggs are then used to unlock new levels, and I put a lot of polish into each aspect.</p>

					<p><strong>Astrodude (0.3)</strong> is a game I entered into the Intel Netbook Competition, hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_94.html" target="_blank">1st place</a>, also announced <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/145151/Winners_of_The_Game_Creators_and_Intel_GamesnbspforNotebooks_Competition_Announced.php">HERE</a>.</p>
					<p>The theme of the competition was to make a game suitable for the new Intel Netbook range, which were basically mini laptops. I decided to make a car physics based dodging game, where you can use the trackpad to 'swipe' the car to dodge obstacles.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming for this game using C++ with the DarkGDK graphics library, and all the artwork in Photoshop. The biggest challenge I faced when making this game was handling the deformation of the terrain. I had to develop a system to efficiently generate (and regenerate) the collision mesh at runtime based on the explosions that deformed the surface. This was quite a challenge because I wasn't aware this had been done before and the algorithm was called Marching Squares, and so I developed the algorithm on my own from scratch.</p>
					<p>The idea with this competition was that the game would later be published on Intel's "App Up" store (now discontinued). In preparing this game for publishing I discovered that due to NPOT scaling issues, my game wouldn't function correctly on some devices. Accounting for this issue was quite difficult using the DarkGDK graphics API, and I wanted to include some more features for the commercially published version, and so I decided to re-write the game from scratch and release it as version 1.0.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges</strong>: "Have everything you understand about physics tested to the maximum in this 2D physics-based driving game. It's a tried and tested formula but with a twist. Set in an extra-terrestrial environment with just enough gravity to keep you planet-bound, the camera view is fixed to the orientation of your dune buggy. Rather than lose your vehicle and starting again when you overturn it, your whole world is turned upside down too. You'll have to wrestle with recovering your vehicle whilst baffled by working out the physical aspects in a upturned world."
						<br/>
						<br/><strong>Duffy, our Intel judge, reports</strong> "Astrodude scored the highest across the board. Well done graphics, good game play for a netbook...'track pad' swipe for a boost is brilliant."</p>

					<p><strong>evo.war</strong> is a game I entered into the Community Competition, hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_77.html" target="_blank">5th place</a>.</p>
					<p>I don't think there was any particular theme, so I just experimented with every idea that popped into my head. What I came up with was a shoot-em-up where the enemies 'evolve' based on how easily you were able to kill them. All ships including your own used the same code, except you were able to choose your upgrades, whereas the enemies were just random mutations. In the end this system didn't really make for fun gameplay or enemies that made any visual sense, so I scrapped the evolving enemy part and just hand-made them.</p>
					<p>I did all programming in this game using C++ with the DarkGDK graphics library. This library doesn't contain any of the fancy feature we now know and love, so developing this game required me to create a UI system from scratch, including a sprite font system. I also developed the ribbon trail (missile trail) system from scratch, which required a lot of mesh manipulation code. I also did some procedural texture work for the progress line, and voronoi upgrade UI picker. The levels are based on text file parsing, and there are many small things I made like a playlist system, particle system, weapon system, modular part handling system, star shadow system, and much more.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges</strong>: "Evo.war is another fine entry from Darkcoder. The attention to visual detail and innovative game play sets it aside from other entries. The principle behind the game is to take a standard side scrolling shooter in the R-Type style, and collect DNA as you work through the levels. You can then "evolve" your ship using collected DNA creating different designs. Starting as a humble egg-shaped craft, progress through the levels with varying weapon configurations. The game play can be very intense at times, almost frustrating; however the ability to adapt your ship to your preferred playing style is a great advantage."</p>

					<p>This is a game I was making using the DarkBASIC Professional software, and was one of the last projects I attempted with it before moving to C++ and DarkGDK. Although I never finished this game, many of the things I learned and even some of its media lives on in my Asset Store product: Space Graphics Toolkit.</p>
					<p>The idea behind this game was to make a realtime space combat MMO, with heavy inspiration from the Stargate TV series.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming for this game, all the 3D artwork, all the shaders, all the UI artwork, and except for the particle animations and planet texture, I did all the 2D artwork too.</p>

					<p>This game was made for the Game Dev Competition hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="http://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_51.html#2" target="_blank">1st place</a>.</p>
					<p>There was no theme to the competition, so I decided to make an open world space RTS, something along the lines of Homeworld. In this game you manage a fleet of ships, some of which can build other ships. You then capture star systems by destroying all enemies in them, and each star system you own generates resources for you. You can then spend these resources on research, upgrades, or new ships. The game is all realtime, with actual bullet physics. You can even zoom into the ships and 'enter' them to assume control, or rely on the AI and your command to control them.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming in this game using DarkBASIC Professional, and did all 3D models using 3DS Max, and most UI and texture work using Photoshop.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges</strong>: "The game play at first has a bit of a learning curve. A stronger manual would have helped greatly, but once understood this is a very professional feeling game, with only a few flaws. You can play the game RTS style or take direct control of a ship in your fleet. You can research new technologies, build new ships and capture new systems. The more you have, the more resources are mined from the planet.
						<br/>
						<br/>These are the cleanest graphics I've seen in the whole competition - high resolution, no lagged edges, no compression marks. The models are simple yet effective; the Star Wars style firing works well. This is a great example of how good art and media really improves a game.
						<br/>
						<br/>The shaders are deployed very well. They are not overly in-your-face, rather subtle enhancements of the existing graphics. They are a great example of how shaders should be deployed in a game. The sound and music work well together, creating the classic feel associated with space games of this type. This is a very polished game. With more development and extra features, I can see this game hitting the shelves. Perhaps some story and character interaction would help aid this game further.
						<br/>
						<br/><strong>In Conclusion</strong>
						<br/>An excellent game and a powerful example of what DarkBASIC Professional can achieve with good solid media behind it."</p>

					<p>The theme of the competition was to make something showcasing the PhysX physics system. I decided to make a physics sandbox, set on an island that was being invaded by aliens. In my game you could place all kinds of physics props, aliens, and humans, and watch them all battle it out.</p>
					<p>All programming was done by me, using DarkBASIC Professional.</p>
					<p>All shaders were written by me, using HLSL.</p>
					<p>Most 3D models were made by me, using 3DS Max.</p>
					<p>All UI and some model textures were made by me, using Photoshop.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges</strong>: "To the victor goes the spoils, and Carlos walks away with the grand prize for a truly excellent all singing, all dancing demo. Sit back and watch it, or get involved interactively. The demo is set on an island paradise, in which you can conjure physics objects all day long. Rain from the sky using real fluids, soft and rigid bodies abound, cloth spawned like magic and everything in between. Do not be surprised if you get carried away creating lots of scenarios to play out on your very own physics island. The visuals are awesome, the help a welcome addition and the whole experience really speaks about the emerging fun to be had with physics."</p>

					<p>The theme of the competition was to make a game using the PhysX physics engine. I decided to make a vertically scrolling helicopter shoot-em-up, where all the enemies and level props used physics.</p>
					<p>Although hard to see, this game features mesh deformation, where the enemy tanks and car props deform as you attack them. It also features basic buoyancy as things fall into the water, a custom particle system, custom UI, and much more.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming for this game using DarkBASIC Professional, I made all of the 3D models, and much of the 2D and UI artwork too.</p>
					<p>Most 3D models were made by me, using 3DS Max.</p>
					<p>All UI and some model textures were made by me, using Photoshop.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges</strong>: "The team behind Paradox have done an exceptional job with their game. Right from the start it has a very good feel about it. The menu system looks very slick and once in the game the action is non stop. You pilot a helicopter and have to navigate over an area that is packed full of tanks and other enemy machinery that are hell bent on causing your destruction. You have to react quickly and move around fast to avoid getting hit while at the same time trying to take down the enemy.
						<br/>
						<br/>There's a lot of detail in this game from the impressive looking water which splashes when fired at, all the objects on the bridge below you such as barrels which you can use to your advantage as they can be blown up and much more. All of this contributes to a fun, addictive game and so far it's been the best use of Dark Physics that we've seen."
						<br/>
						<br/><strong>Lee Bambers Review</strong>: "This game has all the tick boxes checked, a polished game and no mistake. With a little work on the difficulty curve, this could be quite an addictive game. Getting the new players into the action slowly, with fewer, larger, weaker targets would encourage level progression, and a series of warnings when health is low plus the ability to 'collect' health will sustain lastability. A top effort!"</p>

					<p>It was made for and entered into the Alienware programming competition hosted by The Game Creators. I won <a href="https://www.thegamecreators.com/pages/newsletters/newsletter_issue_13.html#10" target="_blank">10th place!</a></p>
					<p>The theme of this competition was to make any game, as long as it featured the alien model they provided.</p>
					<p>In my game, I used the alien as your companion that helps attack enemies, and gives you some dialogue. I didn't think too hard about what to use the alien model for because I just wanted to implement lots of cool guns and effects.</p>
					<p>I did all the programming for this game, using DarkBASIC.</p>
					<p>Besides the one alien model, I did all 3D art and level design for this game using Milkshape 3D.</p>
					<p>For the guns and aliens, I did all the 2D art using PaintShop Pro.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p><strong>Judges:</strong>"Out of all the FPS style games submitted for this competition, we have to admit that the controls and smoothness of Operation Genocide means it was easily the best of that genre. The collision is perfectly smooth, the guns are great - extremely well modelled with punchy sound effects, shell casing ejection and they just all look the part. There are loads of them too, from Uzi's to sniper rifles. We aren't really sure of the plot, but you start the game on the surface of a planet with a hologram of an alien."</p>
