How do I upgrade?
First, make sure you <b>back up</b> your project files.

Next, install the latest version.

If for some reason the latest updates breaks your project (e.g. errors in the console), then try deleting the root folder for this asset, and reinstalling it.

If it still doesn't work then go back to your previous version, and let me know what the errors are, so I can fix it.
